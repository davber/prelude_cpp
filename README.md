# prelude_cpp #

This library provides a functional framework for C++ development, inspired by both Haskell and the old FC++.
It does not try to replace the standard iterator concepts, but rather build upon those, and on the range notion
used by the Boost libraries.

*prelude_cpp* depends on Boost and mostly on *Boost.Range* and *Boost.Iterator*.

The core notion used in *prelude_cpp* is the Concept *Range*, which has the same definition
as in *Boost.Range*.
